# ChessAnalysisCLI

A Python-based project I made for my final year of high school. It wasn't supposed to have all the logic and features it does, it was supposed to be something simple and easy to use. But hey! No harm in adding a bunch of features that took forever to implement, right?

It uses Stockfish, the most powerful chess engine in the world. It interfaces with it be the means of a Python library built for this very purpose. The library provides som very rudimentary, but useful functions. I simply built on top of them to create a basic UX, and some minor functionality and usability. The applicaiton uses a EXECUTABLE (.exe) file as a local model for Stockfish. Hence, this applicaiton is limited to use only WITHIN THE WINDOWS OS. It cannot work on Linux, until, that is - WINE starts supporting it somehow.
